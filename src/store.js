My goal is to continue on with their legacies.",

        "Everyone knows that meditation can reduce stress. But researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital say it directly affects the function and structure of the brain. It increases attention span, sharpens focus, and improves memory.",
        "With the aid of advanced brain scanning technology, one study showed that daily meditation thickens the parts of the brain's cerebral cortex responsible for decision-making, attention, and memory.",
        "The test subjects were Boston-area workers practicing Western-style meditation, called mindfulness or insight meditation. For 40 minutes a day, they focused on an image, a sound, or on their own breathing.",
        "The Insight Meditation Society recommends just sitting in a chair. Close your eyes and follow your breath. Feel the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. If your mind wanders, that's all right. Watch what happens when your mind wanders. Notice it, observe it, then let it go and return to breathing. Be aware of what you're thinking, but don't get caught up in it.",
        "With practice, you can develop a state called mindfulness, which is being aware of what's going on as it arises without jumping to conclusions, judgments, hopes, fears, or plans.",
        "Meditation also improves productivity and reduces absenteeism at work, probably because it helps prevent stress-related illness. helps people get along better. It acts on emotional intelligence, which neuroscientists say is more important for life success than cognitive intelligence."

        "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing a new rule to allow the use of salt substitutes in everyday foods, such as cheese or canned tuna, in an effort to reduce salt consumption among Americans, according to Kaiser Health News.

        "Keeping your body hydrated by taking in enough fluids is an important part of good health. But even if you don't drink the recommended eight glasses of water each day, you probably don't have to worry.",
        "Counting the food and beverages people consume each day, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) says Americans are usually getting enough water without purposely drinking more.",
        "Caffeinated beverages can be counted. IOM's Food and Nutrition board says there is little evidence that caffeinated beverages flush water and its benefits from the body. They do contribute to hydration, but are often full of sugar and phosphates, which can weaken bones and teeth.",
        "The real problem is sodium. The average man takes in two to three times the daily recommended sodium intake and women get twice as much as they need.",
        "The second problem is a lack of potassium, an essential nutrient found in spinach, potatoes, cantaloupe, bananas, almonds and mushrooms. IOM recommends that adults get at least 4.7 grams of potassium daily, but the average man gets between 2.8 and 3.3 grams. Women get between 2.2 and 2.4 grams.",
        "Doctors writing in HealthNews say getting too much salt and too little potassium increases the risk of high blood pressure. Balancing these two nutrients is very important.",
        "Before exercising or when you are outdoors in hot weather, drink extra water to make up for what you lose through sweating.",
        "By limiting salt, getting enough potassium, and drinking more on hot days, you should keep your body properly hydrated."
