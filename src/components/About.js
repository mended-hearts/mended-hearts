        <h4>Cardiac Rehab Partners</h4>
          <p>Cardiac rehab is dedicated to the recovery and medical care of the heart patient. The Mended Hearts Program is focused on the practical aspects of living with a heart condition. We are partners in heart health cases.</p>
          <p>How did it all begin? Twenty three years ago, when I suffered my first heart attack, I was helicoptered from Good Shepherd Hospital to Sherman Hospital in Elgin. Steve Lewis was the Visiting Chair for Mended Hearts at Sherman and later became the Visiting chair at Good Shepherd Hospital. When Steve visited me in the hospital, we had an immediate connection. I asked a lot of questions and he had ready answers. Driving home from Sherman, the idea for a Mended Hearts chapter at GHS popped into my mind. I did not want to drive to Elgin.</p>
          <p>At that time, Rosie Jeretina was the Administrator of the Rehab Center in Barrington. There were only a few machines in the program and with one-on-one contact, Rosie and I became good friends. With Rosieâ€™s assistance, we were able to establish the Mended Hearts Chapter #337 at Good Shepherd Hospital.</p>
        <h4>Forward 23 years</h4>
          <p></p>After suffering a heart attack in April, I once again began my rehab at GSH. The program has now moved down the hall and is filled with many more machines. Patients now wear heart monitors collecting data on blood pressure before, during and after exercise as well as diabetic blood testing. It works like a well oiled machine evaluating each patient.<p/>
